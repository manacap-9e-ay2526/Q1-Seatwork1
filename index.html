  <h3> My 3 favorite Shows</h3>
   <p><strong>Breaking Bad</strong>
   <li>I like breaking bad because it's an interesting and fun show to watch, from the science, to the lore, it's nearly perfect in my opinion. </li>

<p><strong>Better Call Saul</strong>
<li>It's a prequel to breaking bad, but this time the main character is Walter White's lawyer, Saul Goodman. Throughout the story we see what it took to get to where he was in the show. It sounds boring but it was very entertaining for me to watch and is as good as Breaking Bad</li>

<p><strong>The Minecraft Movie</strong>
<li> As of now, I can't really remember any good movies/shows besides this movie. It was kind of corny, but that made it weirdly entertaining. It's not a "must watch" but you should definitely try to watch it if you have free time. </li>
